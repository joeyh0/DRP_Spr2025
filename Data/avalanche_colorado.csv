High Trail Cliffs is a series of four steep rocky northwest-facing avalanche paths that are easily accessed from the parking area at the top of the pass. It was a hard slab avalanche. The avalanche was medium-sized relative to the path and destructive enough to injure bury or kill a person. It released on a weak layer of buried faceted crystals and stepped down to the ground entraining the entire season’s snowpack (HS-ARu-R3-D2-G). The crown face averaged about 2 feet deep and was about 550 feet wide across all four of the avalanche paths in the High Trail Cliffs. The avalanche ran about 525 vertical feet through sparse trees and rocky terrain. The avalanche broke small trees and the debris and broken limbs piled up on a bench below the slope. Debris was over 7 feet deep in places. Portions of the debris reached the historic maximum trimline of the avalanche path., -, G, approved, -, Layer, 550, ft, 400, ft, 24, in, -

The crown face was between 10200' and 10300' and the toe of the debris was approximately 9500 feet in elevation. Slope angles in the starting zone ranged from 35 degrees to 40 degrees in steepness. The avalanche ran approximately 800 feet in elevation. Based upon the nature of the snowpack with its attendant persistent weak layers it is impossible to know exactly who triggered the avalanche.  On the day after the accident Utah Avalanche Center forecasters Dave Kelly and Drew Hardesty went toward the accident site to better understand the nature of the event. There was universal agreement however that conditions remained too dangerous to access the fracture line of the avalanche and therefore avalanche information is only conjecture based upon slope and snowpack history. Based upon zoomed-in photos from both the rescuers and the drone it is estimated that the soft slab avalanche was roughly 2’ deep. This potentially matches the layering of the faceted grains buried on February 1st and it could also match a weakness of graupel from the Friday February 7th storm. It is also conjectured that this slope had avalanched previously on December 29th leaving a layer of weak faceted snow on the bed surface. All three weak layers had been active prior to the accident., -, -, approved, -, Layer, 125, ft, 800, ft, 24, in, -

The crown face of the avalanche was at an elevation of 8800 feet and the toe was at 8600 feet. This avalanche was 394 feet wide. The crown depth averaged 3 feet deep and was 5 feet deep at the maximum crown height.  This slab of wind-drifted snow failed on a layer of buried near-surface facets and broken precipitation particles and also involved the more deeply buried facets that formed near the ground in December of 2024. This was a hard wind slab with large chunks of debris remaining intact in the debris field.  Strong winds heavily drifted the upper portion of the slope creating a dense cohesive pencil-hard wind slab. The slope angle in the rocky area mid-slope was 43 degrees and the slope angle at the crown face averaged 31 degrees.  A notable terrain feature likely related to the extensive wind loading on this slope is the large flat meadow above and behind the slope. This meadow is a large fetch where wind can blow over land for quite a distance with no obstructions. The first available downwind terrain features are the two slopes in the leeward zone: Beer Hill and Whisky Hill. Even in a shallow snowpack season we can see depths of over 15 feet of snow (4 meters) on these slopes based on wind direction., -, O, approved, -, -, 300, ft, -, ft, 36, in, -
