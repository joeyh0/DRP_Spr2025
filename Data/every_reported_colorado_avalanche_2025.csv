The small pocket moved downhill and triggered a much larger wet slab. This avalanche was 200'-300' wide with a crown depth from 30-70cm.  CBAC notes: After a site investigation on 3/25 changed avalanche type from wet slab to soft slab because the main slab on east to northeast facing terrain was mostly dry. It entrained a significant amount of wet snow as it descended and wrapped to warmer aspects thus the debris was wet.  The initial shallow slab on a southeast aspect was wet.

Observed no signs of instability. Upon getting back up around the world there were other tracks in Nirvana trees and a different party of skiers had skied the lowest angle but center gut of Nevada bowl (2 skiers with a dog). Second run was Swamp (skiers right swamp creature) with soft snow on a solar crust. Observed no signs of instability and great skiing. Decided to skin up for a 3rd run and ski back to Ophir via Swamp Angel (NNW). Upon seeing tracks in Nevada Bowl and others there were comments about the Persistent slab and how dangerous it was. There is definitely a sleeping dragon as CAIC reporter mentioned and base structure was generally poor but the lack of observations resulted in a false sense of confidence in the ""dormancy"" of this persistent slab below tree line.  Incident: Skier 1 went first and took an aggressive ski cut towards the skiers left (more north facing ridge) and skied the ridge down crossing another gully and to the ""safety"" pictured. No signs of instability on this run. Skier 2 skied just below skier 1's tracks and upon reaching the ridge caused a D2 avalanche below their skies (pictured) and Skier 1 yelled avalanche from the ridge ""safety"" down below. Skier 2 did not get caught or carried the avalanche debris flowed down the gully (traveling ~800 feet of distance) not near Skier 1 sympathetically releasing another small avalanche on the W facing slope (pictured) and Skier 1 was able to get a photo of the avalanche likely stepping a bit closer to the gully at this point. The first avalanche crown was estimated to be 80cm at its highest point and the W facing crown was estimated to be the new storm snow since Thursday?  Skier 2 then proceeded skiing down the ridge and reached Skier 1 and stopped skiers left of Skier 1. Skier 3 then skied down the ridge staying very close to the tracks of skiers 1 and 2 and crossed the other gully (the south arm of the Y of Swamp Angel). Upon reaching this sub-ridge Skiers 1 and 2 were on Skier 3 turned and caused another avalanche on the ridge skiers 1 and 2 had skied. Skier 3 was knocked off their feet and in the trees but was not carried. They observed a crown of roughly 2 feet and a bed surface of facets. At this time Skiers 1 and 2 heard and felt a loud collapse yelled and the snowpack fractured under their feet into numerous blocks moving downhill. Skier 2 was able to side step and grab a tree but Skier 1 tried to grab a small tree below them and was knocked off their feet and drug down into the gully with the moving snow. At this point Skier 1 deployed their air bag and was carried 260 vertical feet. periodically coming above and below the snow while rapidly moving down the gully. Skier 1 struck a small tree and lost their pole but ended up relatively unscathed (just some bruises) and on top of the debris (they think the airbag was an important part of this).  Upon coming out of the snow Skier 1 yelled uphill and started to initiate a search but quickly heard that skiers 2 and 3 had not been carried. During this incident skier 3 skied down the faceted bed surface and reached Skier 2 and they started to initiate a search but quickly heard from skier 1` yelling up at them and then radioing they were okay. All skiers proceeded to take the safest route down.  Main Takeaways: This incident clearly reflects the challenging and dangerous aspects of a Persistent Slab problem. The group made a poor decision skiing that steep of terrain and was incorrectly given confidence by a lack of any signs of instability. Furthermore the ""safety"" chosen reflected a concern of surface instability and not a deeper and widespread persistent slab problem and they should have taken this into consideration after seeing the first avalanche because the safe zone was indeed not safe.

High Trail Cliffs is a series of four steep rocky northwest-facing avalanche paths that are easily accessed from the parking area at the top of the pass. It was a hard slab avalanche. The avalanche was medium-sized relative to the path and destructive enough to injure bury or kill a person. It released on a weak layer of buried faceted crystals and stepped down to the ground entraining the entire season’s snowpack (HS-ARu-R3-D2-G). The crown face averaged about 2 feet deep and was about 550 feet wide across all four of the avalanche paths in the High Trail Cliffs. The avalanche ran about 525 vertical feet through sparse trees and rocky terrain. The avalanche broke small trees and the debris and broken limbs piled up on a bench below the slope. Debris was over 7 feet deep in places. Portions of the debris reached the historic maximum trimline of the avalanche path., -, G, approved, -, Layer, 550, ft, 400, ft, 24, in, -

The avalanche was medium-sized relative to the path and destructive enough to injure bury or kill a person. The avalanche broke on a facet-crust combination (SS-ASu-R3D2.5-O). The crown face of the avalanche was generally 2 to 3 feet deep and up to 5 feet at the deepest point. The avalanche propagated around a ridge and ran on slopes facing north through east. The avalanche was up to 1300 feet wide and ran 1400 vertical feet. Debris split around several stands of dense trees and other terrain features resulting in several paths of flow. The avalanche ran into a narrow gully at the bottom of the path and then down the gully following the Mineral Creek drainage. Debris spanned over 2000 feet along the gully split into multiple piles and was more than 20 feet deep in places.

The crown face was between 10200' and 10300' and the toe of the debris was approximately 9500 feet in elevation. Slope angles in the starting zone ranged from 35 degrees to 40 degrees in steepness. The avalanche ran approximately 800 feet in elevation. Based upon the nature of the snowpack with its attendant persistent weak layers it is impossible to know exactly who triggered the avalanche.  On the day after the accident Utah Avalanche Center forecasters Dave Kelly and Drew Hardesty went toward the accident site to better understand the nature of the event. There was universal agreement however that conditions remained too dangerous to access the fracture line of the avalanche and therefore avalanche information is only conjecture based upon slope and snowpack history. Based upon zoomed-in photos from both the rescuers and the drone it is estimated that the soft slab avalanche was roughly 2’ deep. This potentially matches the layering of the faceted grains buried on February 1st and it could also match a weakness of graupel from the Friday February 7th storm. It is also conjectured that this slope had avalanched previously on December 29th leaving a layer of weak faceted snow on the bed surface. All three weak layers had been active prior to the accident., -, -, approved, -, Layer, 125, ft, 800, ft, 24, in, -

The crown face of the avalanche was at an elevation of 8800 feet and the toe was at 8600 feet. This avalanche was 394 feet wide. The crown depth averaged 3 feet deep and was 5 feet deep at the maximum crown height.  This slab of wind-drifted snow failed on a layer of buried near-surface facets and broken precipitation particles and also involved the more deeply buried facets that formed near the ground in December of 2024. This was a hard wind slab with large chunks of debris remaining intact in the debris field.  Strong winds heavily drifted the upper portion of the slope creating a dense cohesive pencil-hard wind slab. The slope angle in the rocky area mid-slope was 43 degrees and the slope angle at the crown face averaged 31 degrees.  A notable terrain feature likely related to the extensive wind loading on this slope is the large flat meadow above and behind the slope. This meadow is a large fetch where wind can blow over land for quite a distance with no obstructions. The first available downwind terrain features are the two slopes in the leeward zone: Beer Hill and Whisky Hill.

The avalanche was remotely triggered from below as the party attempted to cross a gully beneath a wind-loaded ridge. The triggered weak layer was formed during a cold dry period early in the season. The weak layer was responsible for the region's numerous human and snowmobile-triggered avalanches the week preceding this accident. This avalanche propagated 350’ uphill to a wind-loaded 38-40 degree slope broken by cliff bands and across three distinct avalanche paths. The avalanche crown was 400’ across and ranged from one to four feet thick. The debris was a mixture of hard slab and softer surface snow which slid 625 feet (400 vertical feet) into a terrain trap (HS-AS(r)-R4-D2.5).

I have been reading the CAIC reports and had full awareness of the large number or remotely triggered avalanches that have been occuring.  I intentionally chose a different route up for this reason--typically I skin the north side of Illinois Gulch but today I skinned the meadow/glade area to the south of the drainage.  While skinning up through the meadow ( I was on a 5 degree slope at the time of the trigger) I felt a large collapse and moments later saw the avalanche just north of where I was skinning.  I didn't get my phone out fast enough to video the avalanche The first photo is from the point where I was skinning when I triggered it.  I skinned up 200' higher to get better photos of the slide. There were no ski tracks anywhere else in the Illinois drainage so i feel sure that no other parties were involved. Using CalTopo I measured 1100-1200 feet from my location to the crownline.  This incident was not a close call because of my distance from the avalanche and I was not in the run out zone.  It's yet another example of how touchy the snowpack is right now., All measurements are estimates.

I estimate it to be an R4 D3 from the crown size. This was one of the larger avalanches I've seen in that area in 20 years of riding in this zone and is indicative of the avalanche problem for all of James Peak Wilderness right now- lots of wind loading on a thin weak base. Big steep slopes coming down from the Continental Divide are reaching their tipping point and are capable of producing large deadly avalanches.

Widespread avalanche activity on northerly to easterly facing slopes. Many more natural avalanches on westerly facing slopes. Some natural avalanche activity on southerly facing terrain but they generally look like they fit in the storm slab category from afar. I'll add many photos to the ob and then start to document the most notable avalanches as time allows. Some of these avalanches were previously documented by Zach. Backster Basion continues on the war zone theme. Looks like some very wide propagating avalanches such as near Daisy Pass.

Strong downslope winds predominated on both the northern facing slopes along the traverse around to Halloween Bowl and within the bowl. Not sure if these winds were actually southeasterly or just strong downslope winds. Much snow was being transported mostly downslope but strong gusts upslope as well. Midway through the bowl regrouped at safe spot. No cracking whumpfing or other signs of instability presented. Snow surface was generally variable wind buff with a thin wind crust on the north and east aspects of the bowl. But we had found no significant consolidation while poking around the snowpack. Skier 1 poked out into the second pitch a wide gully with the plan of dropping across the west-facing terrain to enter the gut of the gully. Almost immediately and with very little pressure the skier triggered a windslab that ran ~200' to ~300' vertical feet. The skier had entered at about 29/30 degrees but the slope rolled over within 4-5 feet downhill into 33-35 degrees sustained for about 300 vertical feet. The slab ran most of this length but the pitch lessened and the mass came to a stop. It did not propogate all the way across the gully and did not entrain the more easterly facing side of the gully. Thankfully Skier 1 remained safely at the crown. Though a portion of slab cracked and broke a few feet above Skier 1 it was not steep enough to slide with the rest of the slab. Slab was about 25-30 cm. The bed surface below the crown was surprising we hadn't found anything that would suggest the presence of this layer. We failed to reevaluate the subtle change in aspect and given the significant wind loading we should have done so., -, -, approved, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -
